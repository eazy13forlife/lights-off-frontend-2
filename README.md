# Lights Off
Lights Off is going to be a fully responsive, full stack movie/tv show application with a bunch of fun features.

## My Current Idea
* So the frontend will have a clean, dark but bold look and organized in a netflix-type style, where we can see  current movies, tv shows and click for more information
* A user can search for whatever it is they are looking for. I'll probably use themoviedb/imdbapi for this.
* User can add any movies that are not listed, it will be stored in an uploads section on the app
* Some sections I want to include: Favorites, Seen, ToWatch list
* You can rate/review anything you've seen(only if you're logged in) and all reviews will be shown under a movie/tv show (don't have to be logged in to see all reviews)

## What I want to work on throughout this project
* Better commit messages and committing more often
* Trying a new stratey of putting everything related to a component inside the same folder, with global components allowed to be shared by child          components.
* Include testing
* Maybe a more efficient redux state structure?

## Technologies I'll be using
* React
* Javascript
* SCSS
* Maybe try bootstrap?
